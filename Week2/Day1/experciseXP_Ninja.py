# Exercise 1 : Call History
# Instructions
# Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. When instantiating an object create an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.
# Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters. The method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phoneâ€™s call_history.
# Add a method called show_call_history. This method should print the call_history.
# Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.
# Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. Each message should be saved as a dictionary with the following keys:
# to : the number of another Phone object
# from : your phone number (also a Phone object)
# content
# Create the following methods: show_outgoing_messages(self), show_incoming_messages(self), show_messages_from(self)
# Test your code !!!
