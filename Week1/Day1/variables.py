#Variables best practice 
#naming a variable in python: 

# 1990_year = not allow

# year_1990 = 67 ok 

# @ju = somethig not allowed 

# _my_variable = "something" allow but we avoid

# PASSWORD = "blabla" allowed 

#multiple word = underscore insted of spaces 

# my_score = 10 

age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"You are {age} years old")
